Example SequentialJob Resource

  apiVersion: batch.example.com/v1alpha1
  kind: SequentialJob
  metadata:
    name: example-job
    namespace: default
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: first-job
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'First job running'; sleep 10; echo 'First 
  job completed'"]
    - name: second-job
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Second job running'; sleep 15; echo 'Second 
  job completed'"]
    - name: third-job
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Third job running'; sleep 5; echo 'Third job
   completed'"]

  Step-by-Step Execution Flow

  Step 1: Initial Reconciliation
  - Resource is created in the Kubernetes API
  - Controller's Reconcile function is called with the resource
  - Resource has no finalizer, so one is added: sequentialJobFinalizer
  - The reconciler exits and waits for another reconciliation

  Step 2: Status Initialization
  - New reconciliation triggered by finalizer addition
  - initializeStatus checks that ObservedGeneration is 0
  - Sets initial status:
  Status:
    StartTime: <current-time>
    State:
      Active: 0
      Succeeded: 0
      Failed: 0
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 0
      CompletedIndices: []
    Conditions:
      - Type: JobsRunning
        Status: False
        Reason: Initializing
        Message: Sequential jobs are being initialized
    ObservedGeneration: 1

  Step 3: Start First Container
  - processSequentialJobs is called
  - Checks that State.Active is 0 and no completion/failure yet
  - Calls startNextJob for index 0 (first container)
  - buildPodForIndex creates a pod definition for the first container
  - Pod is created with labels including sequentialjob.myapp.example.com/index: "0"
  - Status updated:
  Status:
    State:
      Active: 1
      Succeeded: 0
      Failed: 0
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 0
      CompletedIndices: []
    Conditions:
      - Type: JobsRunning
        Status: True
        Reason: JobStarted
        Message: Job at index 0 started

  Step 4: Monitor First Container
  - Pod events trigger reconciliation while first container runs
  - processSequentialJobs checks that State.Active is 1
  - Calls checkActiveJob which finds the pod for index 0
  - Pod is still running, so requeues after 5 seconds
  - No status changes during this monitoring phase

  Step 5: First Container Completes
  - Pod completes successfully with phase PodSucceeded
  - checkActiveJob updates status:
  Status:
    State:
      Active: 0
      Succeeded: 1
      Failed: 0
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 1
      CompletedIndices: [0]
    Conditions:
      - Type: JobsRunning
        Status: True
        Reason: JobStarted
        Message: Job at index 0 started
  - Reconciler is requeued

  Step 6: Start Second Container
  - Next reconciliation finds State.Active is 0 and we're at index 1
  - startNextJob creates pod for second container (index 1)
  - Status updated:
  Status:
    State:
      Active: 1
      Succeeded: 1
      Failed: 0
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 1
      CompletedIndices: [0]
    Conditions:
      - Type: JobsRunning
        Status: True
        Reason: JobStarted
        Message: Job at index 1 started

  Step 7: Monitor Second Container
  - Same monitoring pattern repeats while second container runs
  - Regular checks via checkActiveJob
  - No status changes until completion

  Step 8: Second Container Completes
  - Pod completes successfully with phase PodSucceeded
  - Status updated:
  Status:
    State:
      Active: 0
      Succeeded: 2
      Failed: 0
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 2
      CompletedIndices: [0, 1]
    Conditions:
      - Type: JobsRunning
        Status: True
        Reason: JobStarted
        Message: Job at index 1 started

  Step 9: Start Third Container
  - Next reconciliation starts the third container (index 2)
  - Status updated:
  Status:
    State:
      Active: 1
      Succeeded: 2
      Failed: 0
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 2
      CompletedIndices: [0, 1]
    Conditions:
      - Type: JobsRunning
        Status: True
        Reason: JobStarted
        Message: Job at index 2 started

  Step 10: Third Container Completes
  - Pod completes successfully with phase PodSucceeded
  - Status updated:
  Status:
    State:
      Active: 0
      Succeeded: 3
      Failed: 0
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 3
      CompletedIndices: [0, 1, 2]

  Step 11: Final Completion
  - Next reconciliation sees CurrentIndex (3) >= number of containers (3)
  - All jobs completed, sets completion status:
  Status:
    State:
      Active: 0
      Succeeded: 3
      Failed: 0
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 3
      CompletedIndices: [0, 1, 2]
    CompletionTime: <current-time>
    Conditions:
      - Type: JobsCompleted
        Status: True
        Reason: AllJobsCompleted
        Message: All sequential jobs completed successfully
      - Type: JobsRunning
        Status: False
        Reason: NoJobsRunning
        Message: No jobs are currently running

  Alternative Path: Failure Scenario

  If instead in Step 8, the second container fails:

  Step 8 (Failure):
  - Pod transitions to phase PodFailed
  - checkActiveJob detects failure and updates status:
  Status:
    State:
      Active: 0
      Succeeded: 1
      Failed: 1
    Progress:
      CurrentIndex: 1
      CompletedIndices: [0]
      FailedIndex: 1
      FailureReason: "Container exited with error code 1"
    Conditions:
      - Type: JobsFailed
        Status: True
        Reason: JobFailed
        Message: Job at index 1 failed: Container exited with error code 1
      - Type: JobsRunning
        Status: False
        Reason: NoJobsRunning
        Message: No jobs are currently running due to failure
  - Execution stops, third container is never started

  Key Points in the Execution Flow:

  1. The controller maintains a state machine through the Status fields
  2. Only one container runs at a time (enforced by the Active count)
  3. The CurrentIndex drives which container to run next
  4. The controller is event-based and reacts to pod status changes
  5. If any container fails, the entire sequence stops and is marked failed
  6. The controller handles resource changes by restarting the current job if needed

  This trace demonstrates how the controller implements a sequential execution
  pattern in Kubernetes while maintaining robust state tracking through the Status
  subresource.
